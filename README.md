# Play Framework Example

This project is an example of a basic CRUD application using Play Framework 2 (Java).

It's geared towards the beginner Java programmer who doesn't wants to do all their learning
writing command line tools.

It uses Play Framework 2.3.8 and PostgreSQL 9.1.
Make sure you change the database settings in 'conf/application.conf' before running the application to the settings for your database. If you're using a database other that PostgreSQL 9.1, you'll want to change the database driver found in 'build.sbt'.
